Consider a old-fashioned mail-order (only) catalog company that traditionally sends large holiday catalogs to two million past and one million potential customers. This is an expensive process, as the printing and mailing costs \$3 for each catalog, and typically only 6% of existing customers and 2% of potential customers make a purchase. The average sale to an existing customer nets the company \$55 in profit (i.e., after all expenses), while the average sale to a new customer is smaller and nets the company $40 in profit. Delivery of a catalog without a sale will result, of course, in an expense.

a, 4 points) What is the expected overall profit for this company to continue with their traditional plan?

```{r}
pastCust = 2000000
potCust = 1000000
cost = 3
pastPurchRate = 0.06
potPurchRate = 0.02
avgPastProfit = 55
avgPotProfit = 40

# Expected overall profit = = pR(x) * vR + [1 â€“ pR(x)] * vNR

# First Try - Naive Calculation
EV1 = (pastPurchRate)*(avgPastProfit) + (potPurchRate)*(avgPotProfit)
# Second Try - Subtracting the cost per customer from the average Profit
EV2 = (pastPurchRate)*(avgPastProfit-(pastCust*cost)) + (potPurchRate)*(avgPotProfit-(potCust*cost))
# Third Try - Multiplying the average profit with the number of customers and then 
# subtracting the cost per customer from the average Profit
# I think this is the most accurate?
EV3 = (pastPurchRate)*((avgPastProfit*pastCust)-(pastCust*cost)) + (potPurchRate)*((avgPotProfit*potCust)-(potCust*cost))
# Fourth Try - Subtracting the cost of the customer not making a purchase
EV4 = (pastPurchRate)*((avgPastProfit*pastCust)-(pastCust*cost)) + (potPurchRate)*((avgPotProfit*potCust)-(potCust*cost)) - (1-pastPurchRate)*((avgPastProfit*pastCust)-(pastCust*cost)) + (1-potPurchRate)*((avgPotProfit*potCust)-(potCust*cost))
# Fifth Try - Naive Calculation * the number of customers
EV5 = (pastPurchRate)*(avgPastProfit*pastCust) + (potPurchRate)*(avgPotProfit*potCust)
# Sixth Try - Looking directly at the example of gambling on slides 14
EV6 = ((pastPurchRate)*((avgPastProfit*pastCust)-(pastCust*cost)) + (potPurchRate)*((avgPotProfit*potCust)-(potCust*cost))) - ((1-pastPurchRate)*(pastCust*cost) + (1-potPurchRate)*(potCust*cost))
# Seventh Try - Looking directly at the example of online marketing on slides 15
EV7 = (pastPurchRate * avgPastProfit - (1-pastPurchRate)*cost) + (potPurchRate * avgPotProfit - (1-potPurchRate)*cost)
# Eighth Try - Looking directly at the example of online marketing on slides 15 multiplying by the number of past and potential customers
EV8 = pastCust*(pastPurchRate * avgPastProfit - (1-pastPurchRate)*cost) + potCust*(potPurchRate * avgPotProfit - (1-potPurchRate)*cost)

The company's data analytics department trained a model to predict (Y/N) who will make a holiday purchase from this catalog resulting in the following confusion matrices:

For existing customers
	p	n
Y	4	4
N	2	90

and

For potential customers
	p	n
Y	2	12
N	0	86

b, 6 points) You are tasked to answer the question of whether the company would make more money this season by only sending catalogs to the prospects that are predicted to purchase. Explain your reasoning by clearly showing your work as well as your final answer.
